## Talk on &ldquo;Dissection and fine-mapping of _trans_-eQTL hotspots&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave at the
[Complex Trait Community meeting](http://www.complextrait.org/ctc2015/)
in Portland, Oregon, on 11 June 2015. I also gave a version of this
talk (remotely) to the
[Jackson Lab Center for Genome Dynamics](http://cgd.jax.org) on 10 Feb
2015 and at the
[Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology](https://bscb.cornell.edu)
at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) on 18 Apr 2016.

I've not included the primary data in the repository, so you won't be
able to build the slides.
