## Talk on &ldquo;Dissection and fine-mapping of _trans_-eQTL hotspots&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I gave to the
[Jackson Lab Center for Genome Dynamics](http://cgd.jax.org)
(remotely) on 10 Feb 2015, at the
[Complex Trait Community meeting](http://www.complextrait.org/ctc2015/)
in Portland, Oregon, on 11 June 2015, the
[Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology](https://bscb.cornell.edu)
at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) on 18 Apr 2016,
for the Queenstown Research Week conference in Nelson, New Zealand, on 1 Sep
2016, and at the
[Genetics Program](https://genetics.sciences.ncsu.edu),
[North Carolina State University](https://ncsu.edu), in Raleigh, NC,
on 6 Feb 2017. The slides were changed a bit each time.

I've not included the primary data in the repository, so you won't be
able to build the slides.
