## Talk on &ldquo;Dissection and fine-mapping of trans-eQTL hotspots&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I will give at the Complex Trait
Community meeting in Portland, Oregon, on 8 June 2015. I gave a
version of this talk (remotely) to the
[Jackson Lab Center for Genome Dynamics](http://cgd.jax.org) on 10 Feb
2015.
